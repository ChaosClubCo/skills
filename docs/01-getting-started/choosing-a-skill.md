# Choosing a Skill

The Skills Library contains 507 skills. This guide shows you how to browse, filter, and evaluate skills so you can find the right one for your task.

## Where Skills Live

All master skill definitions are in the `_master-skills/` directory at the project root. They are organized by category:

```
_master-skills/
  ai-agents/          # 232 skills
  technical/          # 127 skills
  strategy/           #  59 skills
  creative/           #  40 skills
  operations/         #  24 skills
  industry/           #  25 skills
```

Each skill has its own subdirectory named with a URL-friendly slug. Inside that directory is a single `SKILL.md` file:

```
_master-skills/technical/code-review-checklist/SKILL.md
_master-skills/ai-agents/multi-agent-orchestrator/SKILL.md
_master-skills/strategy/competitive-landscape-analyzer/SKILL.md
```

The directory name (the slug) is the skill's unique identifier. It is used across all platforms and in all converted output formats.

## Understanding the SKILL.md Format

Every SKILL.md file has two parts: YAML frontmatter and a markdown body.

### Frontmatter

The frontmatter block is enclosed in `---` delimiters at the top of the file. It always contains at least two fields:

```yaml
---
name: Code Review Checklist
description: Performs structured code reviews following a comprehensive checklist covering correctness, security, performance, readability, and maintainability.
---
```

- **name** -- the human-readable display name of the skill.
- **description** -- a one- or two-sentence summary of what the skill does.

Some skills include additional frontmatter fields added by the metadata enricher:

```yaml
---
name: Code Review Checklist
description: Performs structured code reviews following a comprehensive checklist.
tags: [code-review, quality, security]
complexity: intermediate
related_skills: [architecture-review, security-audit, testing-strategy]
platforms: [claude, gemini, codex, copilot]
---
```

- **tags** -- keywords for search and filtering.
- **complexity** -- one of `beginner`, `intermediate`, or `advanced`.
- **related_skills** -- slugs of complementary skills.
- **platforms** -- which platforms this skill is converted for.

### Body Sections

The markdown body follows a standard structure. Not every section is present in every skill, but the common headings are:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Overview | What the skill does and when it is useful |
| When to Use | Specific scenarios and triggers |
| Core Processes | Step-by-step instructions the AI follows |
| Tools & Templates | Frameworks, checklists, and output templates |
| Metrics | How to measure success |
| Common Pitfalls | Mistakes to avoid |
| Integration Points | How this skill connects to other skills |

## Filtering by Complexity

If skills have been enriched with complexity metadata, you can filter by difficulty:

### Using grep

```bash
# Find all beginner-level skills
grep -rl "complexity: beginner" _master-skills/

# Find all advanced skills in the ai-agents category
grep -rl "complexity: advanced" _master-skills/ai-agents/
```

### Using the validator

The skill validator can report complexity across the entire library:

```bash
python lib/skill_validator.py --report complexity
```

### Complexity levels

| Level | Typical Use | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| beginner | Single-step tasks, straightforward instructions | `meeting-agenda-builder` |
| intermediate | Multi-step workflows, requires some domain knowledge | `code-review-checklist` |
| advanced | Complex orchestration, multi-agent, deep domain expertise | `multi-agent-orchestrator` |

---

## Finding Related Skills

Many skills reference related skills in their frontmatter or body. To find skills that work well together:

### Check the frontmatter

```bash
cat _master-skills/technical/code-review-checklist/SKILL.md | head -10
```

Look for the `related_skills` field.

### Search by keyword

```bash
# Find all skills mentioning "security"
grep -rl "security" _master-skills/ --include="SKILL.md"

# Find skills mentioning "API" in the technical category
grep -rl "API" _master-skills/technical/ --include="SKILL.md"
```

### Use the metadata enricher

The enricher can auto-detect related skills:

```bash
python -c "from lib.metadata_enricher import detect_related_skills; print(detect_related_skills('code-review-checklist'))"
```

## Using Bundles

Bundles are pre-curated groups of skills designed for specific use cases. Instead of picking individual skills, you can install an entire bundle.

The library includes 18 bundles across 3 platforms:

## Tips for Choosing

1. **Start with the category** that matches your domain. If you are a developer, start in `technical` or `ai-agents`.

2. **Read the description** in the frontmatter before reading the full body. It tells you in one sentence whether the skill is relevant.

3. **Check complexity** if available. Start with `beginner` or `intermediate` skills to get a feel for the format.

4. **Look at related skills** to build a toolkit. Skills often work best in combination.

5. **Try a bundle** if you are setting up a new workspace. Bundles give you a curated starting point without the overhead of evaluating individual skills.

6. **Search by keyword** when you have a specific task in mind. The grep approach is fast and reliable across the full library.
