  of .DS_Store and .mcpb-cache artifacts. Activates when creating
  distributable skill packages for Cowork, Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or
  skill marketplaces. Also triggers on: zip this skill, package this up,
  validate my skill, is this spec compliant, skill zip broken, prepare for
  install, make this installable, or distribute this skill.

# Packaging Skills — March 2026 Spec

Validates, packages, and distributes Claude skills as zip files compliant with the March 2026 Anthropic specification. Knows every rule the spec defines and enforces them before a zip is created.

## Quick-Start Decision Tree

```
What are you packaging?
  ├─ Single skill directory ─── Standard package (this guide)
  ├─ Plugin with multiple skills ─── Plugin package (wrap in plugin.json manifest)
  ├─ Existing zip to validate ─── Validation-only mode (skip to Step 3)
  └─ Batch of skills ─── Batch mode (loop through directories)
```

---

## Usage Examples

**Example 1 — Package a single skill**
User: "Package the automating-workflows skill for distribution."
→ Locate directory. Validate frontmatter. Check gerund name. Exclude .DS_Store and .mcpb-cache. Create zip with single top-level folder. Verify. Report.

**Example 2 — Validate an existing zip**
User: "Check if this skill zip meets the March 2026 spec."
→ Extract to temp. Run all 14 validation checks. Report findings with PASS/WARN/FAIL per check. Suggest fixes for any failures.

**Example 3 — Package for a plugin**
User: "Package these 3 skills into a Cowork plugin."
→ Validate each skill independently. Check version sync between SKILL.md frontmatter and plugin.json. Create plugin zip with manifest. Verify.

## March 2026 Specification Rules

### Directory Structure (Required)

```
skill-name.zip
└── skill-name/              # Single top-level folder, matches skill name
    ├── SKILL.md             # Required — under 500 lines
    ├── references/          # Optional progressive disclosure
    ├── examples/            # Optional
    ├── resources/           # Optional
    ├── scripts/             # Optional
    ├── templates/           # Optional
    ├── workflows/           # Optional
    └── assets/              # Optional
```

### YAML Frontmatter (Required Fields)

```yaml
---
name: gerund-name-here        # Must match directory name exactly
description: >                # Third-person, what + when, max 1024 chars
  Performs X and produces Y. Activates when user mentions Z.
version: "1.0.0"             # Semver — must match plugin.json if in a plugin
---
```

### The 14 Validation Checks

| # | Check | Level | Rule |
|---|-------|-------|------|
| 1 | SKILL.md exists | FAIL | Must be at root of skill directory |
| 2 | Line count | FAIL | SKILL.md must be 500 lines or fewer |
| 3 | Gerund name | WARN | First segment must end in "-ing" (e.g., packaging-skills) |
| 4 | Name format | WARN | Lowercase, hyphens only, max 64 chars |
| 5 | Reserved words | FAIL | Name must not contain "anthropic" or "claude" |
| 6 | Description format | WARN | Third-person voice, no first-person patterns |
| 7 | Progressive disclosure | FAIL | If SKILL.md >100 lines, must have a valid subdirectory |
| 8 | No nested refs | FAIL | Reference files must not link to sibling reference files |
| 9 | Version sync | WARN | SKILL.md version must match plugin.json version (if in plugin) |
| 10 | .DS_Store exclusion | WARN | Must not be included in zip |
| 11 | .mcpb-cache exclusion | WARN | Must not be included in zip |
| 12 | No secrets | FAIL | No API keys, tokens, or passwords in any file |
| 13 | Single top-level folder | FAIL | Zip must contain exactly one root directory |
| 14 | Package size | WARN | Recommended under 10MB |

### Gerund Naming Rules

The first hyphen-separated segment of the skill name must be a present participle (ending in "-ing"). This is a WARN, not a FAIL — legacy skills may retain non-gerund names.

**Valid:** packaging-skills, creating-hooks, engineering-staff-workflows, producing-ai-newsletter
**Invalid:** skill-packager, create-hooks, staff-engineer-v4, the-prompt-newsletter

### Legacy Detection

If the skill directory contains a `commands/` folder with `.md` files using the old slash-command format (YAML frontmatter with `allowed-tools:` plus a prompt body), flag it: "This skill uses the legacy commands/ format. Cowork plugins use a different command structure — see the plugin specification."

---

## Packaging Process

### Step 1 — Locate and Read

Read the skill directory. Confirm SKILL.md exists. Extract YAML frontmatter. Inventory all files and subdirectories.

### Step 2 — Validate

Run all 14 checks from the table above. For each check, record PASS, WARN, or FAIL with a specific message. Stop on any FAIL and report — do not create a zip with known failures.

### Step 3 — Exclusion Filter

Before creating the zip, exclude these files and directories:

```python
EXCLUSIONS = {
    '.DS_Store',          # macOS metadata
    '.mcpb-cache/',       # Cowork plugin build cache
    '__pycache__/',       # Python bytecode
    '.git/',              # Version control
    '.env',               # Environment secrets
    'node_modules/',      # Dependencies
    '.vscode/',           # Editor config
    '*.pyc',              # Compiled Python
    '.gitignore',         # Git config
    'Thumbs.db',          # Windows metadata
}
```

### Step 4 — Create Zip

```python
import zipfile
from pathlib import Path

def create_skill_zip(skill_dir: Path, output_dir: Path) -> Path:
    skill_name = skill_dir.name
    zip_path = output_dir / f"{skill_name}.zip"

    with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_path, 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) as zf:
        for file_path in skill_dir.rglob('*'):
            if file_path.is_file() and not should_exclude(file_path, skill_dir):
                arcname = f"{skill_name}/{file_path.relative_to(skill_dir)}"
                zf.write(file_path, arcname)

    return zip_path
```

### Step 5 — Verify

Extract the zip to a temp directory. Re-run all 14 validation checks on the extracted content. Confirm the round-trip is clean.

### Step 6 — Report

Output a packaging report with: skill name, version, file count, package size, validation results (14 checks), installation instructions, and output path.

---

## Version Sync Check (Plugin Context)

When a skill is part of a Cowork plugin, the version in SKILL.md frontmatter must match the version in plugin.json. If they differ:

```
WARN: Version mismatch
  SKILL.md version: 1.2.0
  plugin.json version: 1.1.0
  Action: Update one to match the other before packaging
```

---

## Batch Packaging

```bash
for skill_dir in /path/to/skills/*/; do
    if [ -f "$skill_dir/SKILL.md" ]; then
        python3 package_skill.py "$skill_dir" --output /path/to/output/
    fi
done
```

---

## Edge Cases

**Skill over 500 lines with no subdirectory:** FAIL. The packager must not create a zip. Recommend splitting content into references/ before re-running.

**Skill with nested references:** FAIL. If `references/a.md` links to `references/b.md`, the packager flags it. Fix by inlining the referenced content or removing the cross-link.

**Plugin with multiple skills at different versions:** Each skill's SKILL.md version must match plugin.json. If any skill diverges, WARN on the specific mismatch.

**Empty subdirectories:** Exclude from zip. An empty references/ folder provides no progressive disclosure value and inflates the package.

---

## Self-Verification Checklist

Before delivering a packaged zip:
1. All 14 validation checks pass (0 FAIL, 0 WARN preferred)
2. No .DS_Store or .mcpb-cache in the zip contents
3. Single top-level folder matching skill name
4. Gerund naming verified on skill name
5. Version sync confirmed (if in plugin context)
6. Zip extracts cleanly and re-validates
7. Package report generated and delivered to user

## CLAIMS
- The 14-check validation suite covers all March 2026 Anthropic spec requirements for skill packaging
- Gerund naming is a WARN-level convention, not a hard spec requirement — legacy skills may retain old names

## COUNTEREXAMPLE
- A skill could pass all 14 checks and still be low quality if the SKILL.md content is shallow or the reference files are placeholder shells

## CONTRADICTIONS
- The spec recommends 500-line max for SKILL.md but some domain-dense skills (security, compliance) genuinely need more — progressive disclosure into references/ is the escape hatch but adds navigation cost
