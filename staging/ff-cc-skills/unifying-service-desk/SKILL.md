  Intelligent multi-tier IT support (L0-L4) with automatic escalation routing.
  Handles incident triage, troubleshooting, root cause analysis, and vendor
  coordination across 12 issue categories. Use when users report issues,
  troubleshooting any technical problem, performing diagnostics, analyzing
  incidents, or coordinating complex fixes. Always use this skill for any IT
  support request — even casual ones like my headset stopped working,
  can't connect to VPN, Teams is broken, computer is slow, printer
  won't work, locked out of my account, monitor not displaying, app
  keeps crashing, email won't sync, or new hire needs setup. Also
  triggers on incident, ticket, issue, error, outage, troubleshoot, diagnose,
  broken, not working, slow, down, help desk, service desk, support request,
  escalation.

<essential_principles>

These principles apply to EVERY support interaction regardless of tier or category.

1. One Step At A Time
Never dump a full troubleshooting sequence. Present one step, confirm the result, then decide the next action. The previous step's outcome determines the next step — not a predetermined script. This matters because skipping confirmation leads to wasted effort and misdiagnosis.

2. Prove Before You Escalate
Every tier boundary requires documented proof that the current tier's procedures were exhausted. "It didn't work" is not an escalation reason — "Steps 1-4 attempted, service restart returned error 0x80070005 (access denied), driver reinstall completed with no change, logs attached" is. This prevents ping-ponging between tiers and respects everyone's time.

3. Document As You Go
Ticket notes are written during troubleshooting, not after. Every step attempted, every result observed, every error code captured — logged in real time using the ticket-notes template. If a tech gets hit by a bus mid-ticket, the next person can pick up exactly where they left off.

4. Security Incidents Break All Rules
If at any point during triage or troubleshooting you identify a security incident (phishing, compromise, malware, unauthorized access), stop normal workflow immediately. Security incidents bypass tier routing and go to L2 minimum with IR procedures. Do not continue troubleshooting a "slow machine" if the root cause is cryptominer malware.

5. Root Cause Over Symptom Relief
Restarting a service fixes the symptom. Understanding why the service died prevents the next ticket. L0-L1 focus on symptom relief (get the user working). L2+ must pursue root cause. Both are valid — but never confuse one for the other.

</essential_principles>

<intake>

To route this correctly, determine three things:

**First — Who are you?**
- End user experiencing the issue → L0 self-service path
- Support tech working a ticket → Tech path (L1+)
- Engineer investigating a pattern → L2+ path

**Second — What's happening?**
Ask for a one-sentence description of the issue. Map it to one of the 12 categories.

**Third — How bad is it?**
Read `references/sla-priority-matrix.md` and classify P1-P5 based on impact and urgency.

These three inputs (role + category + priority) determine the starting tier.

</intake>

<routing>

**Priority-based overrides (these always win):**
- P1 (business-stopping, multiple users) → Start at `workflows/l2-advanced-diagnosis.md`, skip L0/L1
- Security incident (any priority) → Start at `workflows/l2-advanced-diagnosis.md` with IR track
- Recurring/systemic pattern → Start at `workflows/l3-engineering-escalation.md`

**Role + category routing:**

| Role | Priority | Starting Workflow |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| End user | P3-P5 | `workflows/l0-self-service.md` |
| End user | P2 | `workflows/l0-self-service.md` (fast-track to L1 if unresolved in 15 min) |
| End user | P1 | `workflows/l1-first-touch.md` (tech must engage immediately) |
| L1 tech | Any | `workflows/l1-first-touch.md` |
| L2+ engineer | Any | `workflows/l2-advanced-diagnosis.md` |

**Category → reference file mapping (load the relevant reference when entering a workflow):**

| Category Keywords | Reference File |
|-------------------|----------------|
| audio, headset, sound, microphone, speaker, Teams audio | `references/audio-headset.md` |
| network, VPN, Wi-Fi, internet, DNS, connectivity, proxy | `references/network-connectivity.md` |
| hardware, dock, monitor, display, USB, keyboard, mouse | `references/hardware-peripherals.md` |
| imaging, MDT, deployment, BIOS, boot, image | `references/imaging-deployment.md` |
| app, crash, Teams, Zoom, browser, Office, software | `references/software-applications.md` |
| password, MFA, locked out, access, permissions, SSO, license | `references/access-identity.md` |
| email, Outlook, calendar, mailbox, sync, Exchange | `references/email-calendar.md` |
| slow, performance, CPU, RAM, disk, startup, fan | `references/performance.md` |
| phishing, virus, malware, suspicious, compromise, security | `references/security-incidents.md` |
| new hire, onboarding, offboarding, provisioning, deactivate | `references/onboarding-offboarding.md` |
| printer, print, scan, print queue, scanning | `references/print-scan.md` |
| mobile, MDM, remote desktop, RDP, hotspot | `references/mobile-remote.md` |

If the issue spans multiple categories, pick the primary symptom category and note secondary categories for the tech.

**After determining the starting workflow, read it and follow it exactly.**

</routing>

<escalation_protocol>

All tier transitions use the shared escalation gate: `workflows/escalation-gate.md`

Read it before any handoff. It defines what must be documented, what artifacts to attach, and how to route.

<success_criteria>

A well-executed support interaction:
- Identified category and priority within the first 2 exchanges
- Routed to the correct starting tier without unnecessary steps
- Presented one troubleshooting step at a time with confirmation gates
- Documented every step attempted and every result observed
- Used the escalation gate checklist before any tier transition
- Resolved at the lowest possible tier
- Captured root cause (not just symptom relief) at L2+
- Left a ticket trail that any tech could pick up cold

</success_criteria>
