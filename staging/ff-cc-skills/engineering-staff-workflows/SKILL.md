  task through mandatory SCOPE_MODE gating, applies WSJF backlog
  prioritization, enforces AppSec-grade threat modeling, and covers the full
  stack from frontend to edge to AI pipeline to agent orchestration. Activates
  on multi-file builds, agent or MCP systems, infrastructure work, security
  audits, full-stack features, or any architecture requiring agentic-aware
  design with observability-first patterns. Also triggers on: help me
  architect this, build this properly, review my system design, multi-file
  build, how should I structure this, is this production ready, or any request
  involving 3 or more files or system-level thinking.

# Engineering Staff Workflows v2.0.0

Scope-gated, security-first engineering workflow for production systems. Every task routes through SCOPE_MODE before a single line of code is proposed. Covers frontend through edge through AI pipeline through agent orchestration through observability.

## Quick-Start Decision Tree

```
Request arrives
  ├─ Single file, <1hr fix? ──────────────── SCOPE_MODE: LITE → Skip to Step 4
  ├─ Feature, 2–8hrs, 2–10 files? ────────── SCOPE_MODE: STANDARD → Full 8 steps
  ├─ System build, 16+hrs, platform-level? ── SCOPE_MODE: FULL → 8 steps + WSJF + ADR + threat model
  └─ Ambiguous? ──────────────────────────── Ask: "LITE, STANDARD, or FULL?"
```

**If the user declares SCOPE_MODE in their prompt, skip the clarification and begin.**

---

## Usage Examples

**Example 1 — LITE: Patch a rate limiter**
User: "The /api/upload endpoint has no rate limiting. Fix it."
→ SCOPE_MODE: LITE. Skip to Step 4. Add express-rate-limit middleware with 100 req/15min default. Validate with Zod. Run quality gate. Done.

**Example 2 — STANDARD: Add Stripe billing to a SaaS app**
User: "Add subscription billing with Stripe to the Next.js app. STANDARD."
→ Full 8-step workflow. Clarify plan tier model, webhook handling, Supabase schema for subscriptions. File plan. Implement. Observability. CI gate.

**Example 3 — FULL: Design an agent orchestration platform**
User: "Build the MCP-native automation platform for INT. SCOPE_MODE: FULL."
→ WSJF table first. Architecture with threat model. Agent loop design with context engineering. Full observability pack. ADR for every non-obvious decision. CI/CD with deploy gates.

---

## Activation Triggers

Apply when the request involves any of: multi-file implementation (3+ files or 100+ lines), agent or MCP server or subagent design, n8n or Zapier or Make workflow orchestration, full-stack feature (frontend + API + DB + auth), infrastructure or CI/CD or Cloudflare Workers, security audit or threat modeling, RAG pipeline or vector DB or LLM integration, architecture or system design.

Do NOT activate for single-sentence factual questions, casual conversation, simple snippets under 100 lines, or meta-discussions about this ruleset.

---

## SCOPE_MODE Gate (Mandatory — Run First)

| Mode | Trigger | Output |
|------|---------|--------|
| **LITE** | Fix, patch, single module, <1hr | Direct solution, skip phases 2–3, compress quality gate |
| **STANDARD** | Feature, service, 2–8hrs | Full 8-step workflow, standard docs |
| **FULL** | System, platform, agent pipeline, 16+hrs | Full workflow + WSJF + ADR + threat model + observability plan |

**LITE shortcut:** Skip to Step 4 (Implement). State assumptions. Run quality gate. Done.
**If ambiguous:** Ask exactly: "LITE (quick fix), STANDARD (feature), or FULL (system build)?" — do not proceed until answered.

---

## Decision Priority Order

**Maintainability > Correctness > Security > Observability > Scalability > Performance > Cleverness**

When these conflict, call it out explicitly. Never sacrifice Security silently.

## Workflow (8 Steps)

### Step 1 · Clarify (Max 5 Questions or Explicit Assumptions)

Ask if ambiguous (one message): project lane (Intinc / personal / external), target runtime, database + RLS model, auth provider, deployment target, agentic components (MCP, subagents, n8n, RAG), SLOs (latency p95, availability, throughput), compliance requirements (SOC2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR).

**Default assumptions if unanswered (state explicitly):** Runtime: Node.js LTS. Database: Postgres + Supabase RLS (multi-tenant assumed). Auth: Supabase Auth. Deployment: Vercel (API) + Cloudflare Workers (edge). SLOs: 99.9%, <200ms p95. Compliance: none (flag if PII detected in schema).

### Step 2 · WSJF Backlog (FULL Mode Only)

Produce a living WSJF table before architecture. Re-sort on each update.

| Feature / Task | User Value | Time Criticality | Risk Reduction | Job Size | WSJF Score |
|----------------|------------|------------------|----------------|----------|------------|
| *Example: Auth RLS* | 8 | 5 | 9 | 3 | **7.33** |

WSJF Score = (User Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction) / Job Size. Implement highest first. Archive tasks scoring below 3.0.

### Step 3 · Stack Selection (Pros/Cons Table)

Present options table if 3+ valid approaches exist. Always cite versions. If uncertain: "I cannot verify this version."

### Step 4 · File and Module Plan

Output annotated tree structure showing: agents/, mcp/, lib/, components/, app/api/, types/, tests/. See the Core Implementation reference for the full tree template and code patterns.

### Step 5 · Core Implementation

Apply the mandatory security checklist and code quality standards from the Core Implementation reference. Key rules: all inputs validated with Zod, auth on every protected route, parameterized queries only, rate limiting on all public endpoints, secrets via env only, OWASP Top 10 for LLM Apps reviewed.

### Step 6 · Agentic Systems (When Applicable)

Apply when the request involves agents, MCP, orchestration, or AI pipelines. See the Agentic Systems reference for architecture decisions, context engineering patterns, MCP server design, structured output contracts, and tool call security (ReAct loop).

**Default: single agent + tools. Escalate to multi-agent only when parallelism is provably required.**

### Step 7 · Observability Pack

Required for STANDARD and FULL. Non-negotiable. See the Observability Pack reference for the full implementation: traceId propagation, Sentry wiring, PostHog events, structured JSON logging, LLM token cost tracking, and alert thresholds.

### Step 8 · CI/CD and Documentation

See the CI/CD and Documentation reference for the GitHub Actions pipeline template, required README sections, and `.env.example` template.

## Agent Security Layer (Threat Model)

This section is the security core. Do not weaken or remove.

| Threat | Vector | Mitigation |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Prompt injection (direct) | User input to LLM | Input sanitization; structured prompt templates |
| Prompt injection (indirect) | Webpage/doc/ticket through tool result to LLM | Treat all tool results as untrusted; validate schema |
| Tool poisoning | Malicious MCP tool description | Whitelist MCP servers; audit tool metadata |
| Rug-pull redefinition | MCP tool changed post-approval | Pin tool versions; re-validate on each session |
| Privilege escalation | Agent with elevated creds + injected command | Least-privilege tokens; human gate on destructive ops |
| Context hijacking | Malicious server injecting persistent instructions | Isolate subagent contexts; no cross-session state carry |
| Data exfiltration | Agent instructed to leak to external endpoint | Whitelist outbound domains; log all agent-initiated HTTP |
| Resource theft | Sampling abuse draining token quota | Token budget caps; rate limiting on sampling requests |

**Defense patterns (sanitization, validation, MCP whitelist):** See the Agentic Systems reference for full implementation code.

---

## Frontend Architecture (When Applicable)

Apply to any task touching React or Next.js. Key rules: typed props (no `any`), hydration safety, XSS prevention in RSC, CSP headers configured, no secrets in client-side code, auth state from server only (never localStorage). See the Core Implementation reference for the security headers template.

---

## Quality Gates (Always Last)

### 3 Weaknesses + Patches (Required after every implementation)
```
1. Weakness: [gap] → Patch: [fix]
2. Weakness: [gap] → Patch: [fix]
3. Weakness: [gap] → Patch: [fix]
```

## Mandatory Protocols

**On "continue" / "resume" / "pick up where" / "carry on":** Call `recent_chats(n=5)` immediately. Output 2-paragraph summary: what was being built + tech stack, last known state + open blockers. Resume without asking "What should I continue?"

**On fresh task:** "No prior context found. Starting fresh — say 'continue' if this is a follow-up."

**On task completion (STANDARD/FULL):** End with 3-paragraph Progress and Next Steps: what was delivered, quality gates passed, next steps + open questions.

---

## Perspective Tools (High-Risk Situations)

**Skeptic Inversion:** "What breaks if [component] fails or [assumption] is wrong?"
**Opposite-Day:** "What if we did the inverse — what would that reveal?"
**Counterexample Hunt:** "What scenario disproves this claim?"
**Five Whys:** "Why is [decision] necessary?" — repeat 5 times.
**Adversarial User:** "How would an attacker abuse this agent/tool/endpoint?"

---

## Edge Cases

**Mixed scope:** If a request starts LITE but grows beyond a single module, stop and re-gate: "This has grown past LITE scope. Switching to STANDARD — confirm or adjust."

**Legacy codebase:** If the target repo uses JavaScript (not TypeScript), flag it: "This codebase lacks TypeScript. I'll add types for new files and recommend a migration path." Do not rewrite existing files unless asked.

**Multi-tenant without RLS:** If the database lacks RLS and the system is multi-tenant, flag as a critical security gap before proceeding.

**AWS migration (incoming):** For AWS-bound workloads, use CDK or SST for IaC. Flag the migration context: "AWS is incoming to the stack. This implementation assumes Vercel/Cloudflare today but is designed to be portable."

---

## Reality Filter

Uncertain? Say "I cannot verify this." Non-obvious claim? Cite official source + version. Never use "probably," "might," or "should work" without a caveat. Agent output presented as fact? Always validate against schema first.

---

## Self-Verification Checklist

Before delivering any implementation, verify:
1. SCOPE_MODE was declared and followed
2. Security checklist completed (no items skipped)
3. All code compiles under TypeScript strict mode
4. No hardcoded secrets, no `console.log` in production paths
5. Observability hooks present (STANDARD/FULL)
6. 3 Weaknesses + Patches section included
7. CLAIMS/COUNTEREXAMPLE/CONTRADICTIONS footer present

---

## CLAIMS
- WSJF prioritization produces better outcomes than gut-feel ordering for backlogs with 10+ items
- Single-agent architectures handle 80%+ of production use cases without multi-agent complexity
- Input sanitization patterns block known prompt injection vectors but cannot prevent all novel attacks

## COUNTEREXAMPLE
- WSJF fails when User Value scores are inflated by stakeholder politics rather than measured data
- Single-agent breaks down when tasks require genuine parallelism with incompatible tool contexts

## CONTRADICTIONS
- "Security first" conflicts with "fast LITE mode" — LITE compresses the security checklist, which means some checks may be deferred
- Observability is "non-negotiable" but adds 15–20% implementation overhead on simple features
