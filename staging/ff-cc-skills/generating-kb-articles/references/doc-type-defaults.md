# Doc Type Smart Defaults

Each doc type includes a set of **required sections** (always generated) and **optional sections** (included by smart default for that type). Users can add or remove optional sections during the Q&A phase.

## Required Sections (All Doc Types)

These sections are always included regardless of doc type:

- **Cover Page** — Title, subtitle ("Created by INT [Department] Team; [Month Year]"), intro paragraph, callout legend
- **Important Links** — External/internal documentation links
- **Contact Us** — Department support email
- **Table of Contents** — Auto-generated from headings
- **Primary Content** — Main body (structure varies by doc type)
- **Appendices** — At minimum Appendix A placeholder; content-dependent

## Smart Defaults by Doc Type

### SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)
| Section | Included | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|

| Numbered Steps with Expected Results | YES | Core SOP pattern |
| Validation & Verification Checklist | YES | SOPs need completion confirmation |
| Escalation & Exception Handling | YES | What to do when the process breaks |
| RACI Matrix | YES | SOPs are role-dependent |
| Version History Table | YES | SOPs are audited documents |
| Assumptions & Limitations | NO | Usually unnecessary for SOPs |

### Reference Guide
| Section | Included | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Decision Tree | NO | Reference guides are informational, not decisional |

| Numbered Steps | NO | Not procedural |
| Validation & Verification | NO | Nothing to verify |
| Escalation & Exception Handling | NO | Not a process |
| RACI Matrix | NO | Not role-based |

| Version History Table | YES | Troubleshooting evolves with system changes |
| Assumptions & Limitations | YES | Environment-specific details |

### Runbook
| Section | Included | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|

| Version History Table | YES | Onboarding evolves |
| Assumptions & Limitations | NO | Usually straightforward |

### Process Document
| Section | Included | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Decision Tree | YES | Process routing decisions |
| Requirements & Prerequisites | YES | Cross-functional inputs needed |
| Numbered Steps | YES | Process flow steps |
| Validation & Verification | YES | Process completion gates |
