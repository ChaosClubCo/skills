## Newsletter Header Format

### Visual Design Spec (all formats)

The header uses a terminal prompt metaphor:

```
[orange left bar] > THE PROMPT█  [blinking cursor]
                  ─────────────────────────────────
                  by INT • Your weekly AI intelligence brief

                  WEEK [N]  ·  [DATE]

                  [ALL STAFF] [TECH DEPT] [AI TEAM]    ⏱ 3 MIN READ
```

Key elements:
- **`>`** in Meteor orange (`#E2690E`) — terminal prompt symbol, left of title
- **`THE PROMPT`** in white, bold, all-caps
- **Blinking cursor block** (`█`) after title — orange, CSS animation in HTML/React
- **Orange underline** below the full title line
- **Diagonal brand stripes** on right side — Eclipse/Deep Space gradient
- **Circuit node** decoration top-right — orange center node, Deep Space satellite nodes
- **Ghost terminal text** (decorative, right zone): `$ claude --model opus-4.6 / Analyzing sources... / ✓ Week N ready`
- **Tier badges** — pill shapes, color-coded: All Staff = Deep Space, Tech Dept = green, AI Team = orange
- **Reading time badge** — Eclipse background, Meteor orange border and text
- **Bottom bar** — Dark BG with `intinc.com · Our Purpose is Your Business`

### Tier-Specific Subtitles

| Tier | Subtitle |
|------|----------|
| Non-Tech (All Staff) | What happened in AI this week — and what it means for INT Inc. |
| Tech Department | Tools, APIs, benchmarks, and action items for engineering and service desk. |
| AI Team | Competitive intelligence, architecture patterns, and strategic positioning for INT's AI practice. |

### Per-Format Header Implementation

**HTML email:** Full-width banner. Eclipse background. Inline CSS only (no `<style>` blocks — Outlook strips them). Static version of the header (no animation). Max-width 600px.

**DOCX:** Text-based header. "THE PROMPT" as H1 in Eclipse dark blue, orange horizontal rule below, subtitle in Deep Space, tier identifier as styled paragraph. No images required.

**Teams post:** No visual banner (Teams strips styling). Use: `# > THE PROMPT — Week [N]` as the opening line. Follow with bold tier indicator and reading time.

**SharePoint / React:** Use the full animated React component with blinking cursor and typewriter terminal effect.

## Hidden Gem Features — Full Specification

These 9 features appear in EVERY issue. They are non-negotiable. They are what make
The Prompt feel crafted, not automated. The "Free This Week" section is the highest-retention
feature — it turns the newsletter from a read into a tool.

### 1. Reading Time Estimate ⏱
- **Position:** Immediately after the date/tier line in the header block
- **Format:** `⏱ Reading time: ~[N] minutes`
- **Calculation:** ~250 words per minute
- **Non-Tech:** ~2 min | **Tech Dept:** ~4 min | **AI Team:** ~5 min (weekly)

### 2. Stat of the Week 📊
- **Position:** First content element after header, before "Last Week We Said..."
- **Format:** Callout box with Meteor orange (`#E2690E`) left border
- **Content:** One compelling statistic. Number + plain-English context + source URL.
- **Framing per tier:**
  - Non-Tech: Plain English with comparison ("roughly the value of...")
  - Tech Dept: Technical metric with benchmark name
  - AI Team: Strategic context with InVelo implication
- **Rules:** Same stat can be used across tiers with different framing. Do not repeat a
  stat within 4 weeks (track in continuity log).

### 3. "Last Week We Said..." Callback 🔁
- **Position:** After Stat of the Week, before main content sections
- **Format:** Indented block with Deep Space (`#5391AA`) left border
- **Content:** 2–3 sentences. Reference a specific claim or prediction from the previous
  edition. Connect to this week's developments. Must include the update or status.
- **Source:** Continuity log (`workflows/continuity.md`)
- **If no previous edition:** Skip and note `[First edition — no callback]`

### 4. Shareable One-Liner Quote 💬
- **Position:** Flexible — after the most impactful section or between sections 2 and 3
- **Format:** Boxed with Light Gray (`#F5F5F5`) background, slightly larger font. Designed
  to be copy-pasted into Slack, email, Teams, or LinkedIn.
- **Content:** A single standalone quotable sentence. Works without context.
- **Tone per tier:**
  - Non-Tech: Accessible, conversational
  - Tech Dept: Technical precision
  - AI Team: Strategic depth — suitable for Kyle's LinkedIn

### 5. Source Citations with Clickable Links 🔗
- **Format:** Inline hyperlinks in body text. For contentious claims: `(Source: [Publication](URL), [Date])`
- **Rules:** Every factual claim needs a source. No exceptions. Internal INT knowledge:
  note `(Source: INT internal)`.
- **HTML:** `<a>` tags with `target="_blank"`
- **DOCX:** Hyperlinked text
- **Teams:** `[text](URL)` markdown

### 6. Visual Header/Banner 🎨
- See full spec in "Newsletter Header Format" section above.
- The header is the brand. Consistent across all formats, adapted to each medium's constraints.

### 7. "Did You Know?" Short Fact 💡
- **Position:** Between sections (flexible — natural break point)
- **Format:** Small callout box with Deep Space (`#5391AA`) accent
- **Content:** 1–2 sentences. Surprising, curious AI fact. Does not need to be this week's
  news — general AI facts, historical context, or counterintuitive data points all work.
- **Tone:** Light, interesting. Not critical information — a palate cleanser.
- **Tracking:** Log in continuity file to avoid repetition.

### 8. "I Wish a Veteran Told Me" Beginner Tip 🎓
- **Position:** Near end of edition, before sign-off
- **Format:** Callout box with Meteor orange (`#E2690E`) accent, friendly tone
- **Content:** A practical, specific tip for using AI tools. Friendly advice from someone
  who's been there. Voice: "When [situation], try [specific action]. It saves [time/effort]
  because [reason]."
- **Tier:** **NON-TECH EDITION ONLY.** Do not include in Tech Dept or AI Team.
- **Tracking:** Log in continuity file to avoid repetition.

### 9. Free This Week 🎁  ← NEW
- **Position:** After "Did You Know?" — before sign-off in all tiers
- **Format:** Distinct callout box. Green "FREE" badge. Copyable prompt box for Non-Tech,
  code block for Tech/AI Team.
- **Content:** A ready-to-use deliverable tied to the week's top story. One per issue.
  - **Non-Tech:** A copy-paste AI prompt for a real work task related to the week's news.
    Example: "Paste this into Claude to summarize your next vendor contract in plain English."
  - **Tech Dept:** A code snippet, API example, or CLI command from the week's developments.
    Example: Gemini 3.1 Pro migration one-liner, or a new MCP server config snippet.
  - **AI Team:** A strategic analysis template, framework, or prompt tied to the week's
    story. Example: "Use this prompt to generate a vendor risk assessment for your clients."
- **Why this matters:** This section turns The Prompt from a read into a tool. People will
  forward the issue specifically to share the Free This Week deliverable. It is the
  highest-retention feature in the newsletter. Never skip it.
- **Tracking:** Log each deliverable type in continuity file to maintain variety.
