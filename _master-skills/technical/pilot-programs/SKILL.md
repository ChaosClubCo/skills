# Pilot Programs

## Overview

Pilot programs are controlled experiments that test new initiatives, products, or processes with a limited audience before broader deployment. By validating assumptions with real users in real conditions, pilots reduce risk, build organizational confidence, and generate learning that improves final implementations.

Effective pilots balance the need for valid learning with practical constraints of time, resources, and organizational patience. They require clear success criteria defined upfront, rigorous measurement throughout, and disciplined decision-making at the end that resists both premature abandonment and unjustified expansion.

The pilot mindset treats early implementation as a hypothesis to be tested rather than a commitment to be defended. This experimental orientation accelerates learning and increases the likelihood of ultimate success.

### Why This Matters

Full-scale rollouts of unvalidated initiatives often fail expensively. Pilots provide a lower-risk path to learning, enabling organizations to fail fast on bad ideas while building evidence for good ones. The investment in piloting typically pays for itself many times over through avoided failures and improved implementations.

## When to Use

### Primary Triggers

- Launching new products or services
- Implementing significant process changes
- Deploying new technology systems
- Testing pricing or packaging changes
- Entering new markets or segments
- Introducing organizational changes
- Validating business model assumptions

### Specific Use Cases

| Scenario | Pilot Type | Duration | Scale |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| New Feature | A/B test | 2-4 weeks | 5-20% of users |
| New Market | Geographic pilot | 3-6 months | 1-2 regions |
| New Process | Process pilot | 6-12 weeks | 1-2 teams |
| New Product | Beta program | 2-3 months | 50-500 users |
| New Pricing | Price test | 4-8 weeks | Segment sample |
| New Technology | Tech pilot | 8-16 weeks | Department |

## Core Processes

### Phase 1: Pilot Design

#### Pilot Scoping Framework

```markdown
## Pilot Design Canvas

### Strategic Context
- Initiative: [What we're testing]
- Hypothesis: [What we believe will happen]
- Business case: [Why this matters]
- Risk level: [High/Medium/Low]

### Learning Objectives
Primary: [The main question to answer]
Secondary:
- [Additional question 1]
- [Additional question 2]
- [Additional question 3]

### Pilot Parameters
- Duration: [Timeframe]
- Scale: [Size of pilot population]
- Location: [Where/who]
- Resources: [What's needed]

### Success Criteria
Must-have:
- [Criterion 1]: [Threshold]
- [Criterion 2]: [Threshold]

Nice-to-have:
- [Criterion 3]: [Threshold]
- [Criterion 4]: [Threshold]

### Constraints
- Budget: [$X]
- Timeline: [Hard deadline if any]
- Scope: [What's fixed]
- Dependencies: [What's needed from others]
```

#### Hypothesis Development

```markdown
## Hypothesis Template

### Format
"We believe that [action/change] for [target audience]
will result in [expected outcome] because [rationale].
We'll know this is true when [measurable signal]."

### Example Hypotheses

#### Product Hypothesis
"We believe that adding one-click checkout for mobile users
will result in 15% higher conversion rates because
our analytics show 40% cart abandonment at checkout.
We'll know this is true when mobile conversion exceeds 3.5%."

#### Process Hypothesis
"We believe that automating customer onboarding emails
will result in 20% faster time-to-value because
manual processes create delays and inconsistency.
We'll know this is true when median activation time drops below 3 days."

#### Business Model Hypothesis
"We believe that offering annual pricing with 20% discount
will result in higher LTV and lower churn because
committed customers are more engaged.
We'll know this is true when annual plan retention exceeds 85%."
```

### Phase 2: Pilot Planning

#### Participant Selection

```markdown
## Pilot Participant Criteria

### Selection Approaches

#### Representative Sample
- Mirrors full population demographics
- Enables generalization of results
- Random selection within criteria
- Requires sufficient sample size

#### Strategic Selection
- Targets specific segments
- Tests where impact highest
- May not generalize
- Faster, more focused learning

#### Volunteer/Opt-In
- Self-selected participants
- Higher engagement likely
- Selection bias risk
- Good for early feedback

### Sample Size Considerations

| Pilot Goal | Minimum Sample | Statistical Note |
|------------|---------------|------------------|
| Directional learning | 20-50 | Qualitative insights |
| Trend detection | 100-200 | Pattern identification |
| Statistical significance | 400+ | A/B test validity |
| Segment analysis | 100+ per segment | Subgroup comparison |

### Participant Selection Criteria Template
| Criterion | Include | Exclude | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Customer type | | | |
| Usage level | | | |
| Tenure | | | |
| Geography | | | |
| Technical profile | | | |
```

#### Success Metrics Definition

```markdown
## Success Criteria Framework

### Metric Types

#### Primary Metrics (2-3)
- Directly measure hypothesis
- Must hit to proceed
- Clear, unambiguous threshold

#### Secondary Metrics (3-5)
- Measure important side effects
- Inform but don't determine decision
- Watch for unexpected changes

#### Guardrail Metrics (2-3)
- Must NOT get worse
- Protect against unintended harm
- Veto power over proceed

### Threshold Setting

| Metric | Baseline | Minimum | Target | Stretch |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|---------|
| Primary 1 | X | +10% | +20% | +30% |
| Primary 2 | Y | +5% | +15% | +25% |
| Secondary 1 | Z | Neutral | +10% | +20% |
| Guardrail 1 | A | No decline | - | - |

### Decision Matrix
| Primary 1 | Primary 2 | Guardrails | Decision |
|-----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Hit | Hit | OK | Proceed to full rollout |
| Hit | Miss | OK | Proceed with modifications |
| Miss | Hit | OK | Iterate and re-pilot |
| Any | Any | Fail | Stop, investigate |
| Miss | Miss | OK | Kill or major pivot |

## Common Pitfalls

### Pilot Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Unclear Success Criteria**
   - Problem: No definition of "what good looks like"
   - Impact: Subjective, contested decisions
   - *Mitigation*: Define metrics and thresholds before launch

2. **Pilot Too Short**
   - Problem: Insufficient time for behavior change
   - Impact: False negative results
   - *Mitigation*: Allow for adoption curve, minimum 4-6 weeks

3. **Pilot Too Small**
   - Problem: Results not statistically meaningful
   - Impact: False confidence in results
   - *Mitigation*: Calculate required sample size upfront

4. **Selection Bias**
   - Problem: Pilot participants not representative
   - Impact: Results don't generalize
   - *Mitigation*: Random selection or document bias clearly

5. **Moving the Goalposts**
   - Problem: Changing criteria mid-pilot
   - Impact: Lost credibility, wasted effort
   - *Mitigation*: Lock criteria before launch, use secondary metrics

6. **Ignoring Negative Results**
   - Problem: Rationalizing failures, proceeding anyway
   - Impact: Failed full rollout
   - *Mitigation*: Commitment to data-driven decisions, independent evaluation

7. **No Control Group**
   - Problem: Can't attribute changes to pilot
   - Impact: False causation
   - *Mitigation*: Maintain comparison group when possible
