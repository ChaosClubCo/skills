# Product Metrics

## Overview

Product metrics transform product intuition into evidence-based decision making. By establishing clear measurement frameworks, teams can objectively assess product health, validate hypotheses, prioritize investments, and demonstrate value to stakeholders.

Effective product metrics go beyond vanity numbers to capture meaningful signals about user behavior, business impact, and product quality. The discipline encompasses metric selection, instrumentation, dashboard design, analysis, and the cultural practices that ensure data informs decisions.

The goal is not measurement for its own sake but actionable intelligence that accelerates learning and improves outcomes. Great product teams know what to measure, how to interpret changes, and when to act on signals versus noise.

### Why This Matters

Without metrics, product teams operate blind, making decisions based on opinion, loudest voices, or anecdote. With metrics, teams can validate assumptions, detect problems early, optimize funnels, and build compelling cases for investment. Data-driven organizations consistently outperform competitors in product-market fit and operational efficiency.

## When to Use

### Primary Triggers

- Launching new products or features
- Establishing success criteria for initiatives
- Building executive dashboards
- Investigating user behavior patterns
- Prioritizing product roadmap
- Evaluating A/B test results
- Preparing board or investor updates
- Diagnosing product health issues

### Specific Use Cases

| Scenario | Metrics Focus | Key Outputs |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| New Feature Launch | Adoption, activation | Feature dashboard |
| Growth Initiative | Acquisition, conversion | Funnel analysis |
| Retention Problem | Churn, engagement | Cohort analysis |
| Monetization | Revenue, LTV | Business metrics |
| Quality Concerns | Errors, performance | Health dashboard |
| User Research | Behavior patterns | Usage analysis |

## Core Processes

### Phase 1: Metrics Framework Design

#### North Star Metric Selection

```markdown
## North Star Metric Criteria

A North Star Metric should:
1. Measure value delivered to customers
2. Correlate with long-term business success
3. Be actionable by product team
4. Guide prioritization decisions
5. Be understandable across the org

### North Star Examples by Business Type

| Business Type | North Star Metric | Rationale |
|--------------|------------------|-----------|
| SaaS B2B | Weekly Active Workspaces | Team adoption drives retention |
| Marketplace | Gross Transaction Value | Matches buyer/seller value |
| Social Media | Daily Active Users | Engagement drives ad revenue |
| Subscription | Monthly Retained Revenue | Combines growth and retention |
| E-commerce | Repeat Purchase Rate | Customer value beyond CAC |
| Developer Tool | Weekly Deployments | Usage = value delivered |
```

#### Metrics Hierarchy Framework

```markdown
## Metrics Pyramid

                    [North Star]
                         |
        +----------------+----------------+
        |                |                |
   [Acquisition]   [Engagement]    [Monetization]
        |                |                |
   +----+----+    +------+------+    +----+----+
   |    |    |    |      |      |    |    |    |
  L1   L2   L3   L1     L2     L3   L1   L2   L3

### Level Definitions
- North Star: Single metric representing overall product health
- Pillar Metrics: Core dimensions of product success (3-5)
- Supporting Metrics: Detailed measures under each pillar (3-5 each)
- Diagnostic Metrics: Deep-dive measures for investigation
```

#### Input vs. Output Metrics

```markdown
## Metric Type Classification

### Output Metrics (Lagging)
- Measure results/outcomes
- Typically slower to move
- Often what stakeholders care about
- Examples: Revenue, Churn, NPS

### Input Metrics (Leading)
- Measure activities/behaviors
- Faster feedback signal
- More directly actionable
- Examples: Feature usage, Time in app, Actions completed

### Connecting Inputs to Outputs

Input Metric → Leading Indicator → Output Metric

Example Chain:
Onboarding completion → Week 1 activation → 90-day retention

### Building Your Metric Model
1. Define output metrics (what success looks like)
2. Identify input metrics (what drives success)
3. Validate correlation between inputs and outputs
4. Focus team on moving input metrics
5. Track output metrics for validation
```

```

#### Metric Investigation Framework

```markdown
## Metric Deep Dive Process

### Step 1: Quantify the Change
- What changed? (metric name and direction)
- How much? (absolute and percentage)
- When? (date range affected)
- Compared to what? (baseline period)

### Step 2: Segment Analysis
- By user segment (new vs. existing)
- By platform (web vs. mobile)
- By geography (region/country)
- By acquisition source
- By plan type (free vs. paid)

### Step 3: Correlate Events
- Product changes deployed
- Marketing campaigns launched
- External factors (seasonality, news)
- Technical incidents
- Competitive actions

### Step 4: Hypothesis Formation
- List possible causes
- Estimate likelihood of each
- Identify data to validate/invalidate

### Step 5: Action Decision
- If cause identified: Plan response
- If uncertain: Design test
- If noise: Document and monitor

## Common Pitfalls

### Metrics Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Vanity Metrics Focus**
   - Problem: Tracking numbers that feel good but don't drive decisions
   - Example: Total registered users (vs. active users)
   - *Mitigation*: Ask "What would we do differently if this changes?"

2. **Missing Baseline**
   - Problem: No benchmark to evaluate against
   - *Mitigation*: Always establish baseline before changes

3. **Correlation vs. Causation**
   - Problem: Assuming metric A causes metric B
   - *Mitigation*: Use experiments to establish causality

4. **Gaming Metrics**
   - Problem: Teams optimize metric at expense of user value
   - *Mitigation*: Balance with counter-metrics

5. **Analysis Paralysis**
   - Problem: Waiting for perfect data before deciding
   - *Mitigation*: Set decision thresholds in advance

6. **Ignoring Cohort Effects**
   - Problem: Mixing new and old users in analysis
   - *Mitigation*: Always segment by user age/cohort

7. **Sample Size Blindness**
   - Problem: Drawing conclusions from too little data
   - *Mitigation*: Calculate required sample size before analyzing
