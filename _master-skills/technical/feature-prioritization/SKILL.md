# Feature Prioritization

## Overview

Feature prioritization is the systematic process of determining which features, improvements, or initiatives should receive development resources and in what order. Effective prioritization transforms an overwhelming backlog into a focused, strategic sequence that maximizes value delivery while managing resource constraints and stakeholder expectations.

Prioritization frameworks provide objective, transparent methods for making difficult trade-off decisions. They replace opinion-driven debates with evidence-based discussions, create alignment across teams, and ensure resources flow to the highest-impact opportunities. The best prioritization approaches combine quantitative scoring with qualitative judgment, recognizing that not all factors can be reduced to numbers.

### Why This Matters

Poor prioritization is one of the most common causes of product failure and organizational frustration. Teams that lack clear prioritization frameworks often build features that don't move key metrics, waste resources on low-impact work, and create internal conflict over competing priorities. Effective prioritization can increase feature success rates by 2-3x while dramatically reducing wasted development cycles and improving team morale through clarity and purpose.

## When to Use

### Primary Triggers

- **Quarterly Planning**: Setting priorities for upcoming development cycles
- **Backlog Grooming**: Regular maintenance of prioritized feature list
- **Resource Allocation**: Determining team or budget allocation
- **Stakeholder Conflict**: Resolving competing priority requests
- **Strategy Shift**: Reprioritizing after strategic direction change
- **Capacity Constraints**: Too many requests for available resources

### Specific Use Cases

## Common Pitfalls

### Prioritization Anti-Patterns

1. **HiPPO Decisions**: Highest Paid Person's Opinion overrides data
   - *Mitigation*: Framework-first discussion, transparent scoring

2. **Squeaky Wheel**: Loudest stakeholder wins
   - *Mitigation*: Objective criteria, equal voice process

3. **Recency Bias**: Last input gets highest priority
   - *Mitigation*: Batch prioritization, cooling-off period

4. **Sunk Cost**: Continuing low-value work due to prior investment
   - *Mitigation*: Regular reprioritization, exit criteria

5. **Scope Creep**: Priorities expand without rescoring
   - *Mitigation*: Rescore on scope change, capacity gates

6. **Analysis Paralysis**: Over-scoring, never deciding
   - *Mitigation*: Time-boxed prioritization, decision deadlines

7. **Local Optimization**: Maximizing component vs. system
   - *Mitigation*: Portfolio view, dependency awareness

8. **False Precision**: Over-confidence in scores
   - *Mitigation*: Confidence factors, ranges not points
